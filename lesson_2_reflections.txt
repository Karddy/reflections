What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--> when i initialize a new repository an empty .git file is created. we initialize it keep track of the commits made to that file in that repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
---> the staging area consists of the select file that needs to be commited from a list of files. It helps us in creating commits for the 
specific changes we did rather than commiting all the changes at the same time.
