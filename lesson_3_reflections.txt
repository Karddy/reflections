When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
---> we would use a remote repository when we want or are sharing the code with our colleagues and he gets a bug fix and commits it on github and we want that commit to be pushed locally

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
---> that would be better than automatic as if the changes made to or the new commit is not desirable then it need not be pulled hence a better choice.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
---> fork is creating a clone on the github server and not locally on the PC whereas clone is what is bieng described of creating a copy locally.
branch is just a distraction from the master.
