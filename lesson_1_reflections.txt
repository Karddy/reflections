Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
it just makes it more simple to commit once rather than a commit for each separate file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
so, if i want to produce the diff between two files using the git diff command i compare the two files and to the changes the two files i use the git log.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i want to try developing my app in android
